This project is a lightweight C-based parser for OpenStreetMap (OSM) data stored in the compact PBF (Protocolbuffer Binary Format). It is designed to read and extract geographic information using custom-built protocol buffer parsing logic. The tool processes OSM map data streams directly from standard input or file input and supports querying various components such as nodes, ways, and map summaries through a flexible command-line interface.

The parser operates on raw binary PBF files without relying on external protobuf libraries, instead manually decoding fields based on the protocol buffer wire format. It also handles compressed blobs using zlib and performs efficient memory management using custom message structures. The implementation emphasizes low-level manipulation of binary formats and input/output handling, offering insights into how map data is stored, streamed, and interpreted at the byte level.
